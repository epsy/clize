clize is a Python module that consists of a function decorator which
Python programmers can use to quickly turn Python functions into
usable command-line applications.  It is compatible with Python 2.6,
2.7, 3.1 and forwards.


Installing
==========

With sufficient privileges::

    ./setup.py install


Using clize in your programs
============================

Write your program as a function with the appropriate parameters::

    def echo(text, reverse=False):
        if reverse:
            text = ''.join(reversed(text))
        print(text)

There we have a simple printing function that allows you via an
optional parameter to reverse the output.  We can play around with it
in an interactive session::

    >>> echo("Hello world!")
    Hello world!
    >>> echo("Hello world!", reverse=True)
    !dlrow olleH

To CLIze your function, import the clize decorator from the clize
module and apply it to your function::

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    from clize import clize

    @clize
    def echo(text, reverse=False):
        if reverse:
            text = ''.join(reversed(text))
        print(text)

Then, add the usual code to run your function with command-line
arguments::

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        import sys
        echo(*sys.argv)

Make sure your script is executable, and run its help::

    $ ./echo.py --help
    Usage: ./echo.py [OPTIONS] text

    Positional arguments:
      text  

    Options:
      --reverse   
      -h, --help   Show this help

Well there's something! clize already auto-generated ``--help`` for
you!  It has blanks to be filled, but that looks pretty much like what
we wanted.

::

    $ ./echo.py 'Hello world!'
    Hello world!
    $ ./echo.py --reverse 'Hello world!'
    !dlrow olleH
    $ ./echo.py 'Hello world!' --reverse
    !dlrow olleH

Why the quotes, you might ask.  Good question. Let's try without.

::

    $ ./echo.py Hello world!
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "./echo.py", line 13, in <module>
        echo(*sys.argv)
      File "/usr/lib/python3.2/site-packages/clize.py", line 381, in _getopts
        raise ArgumentError(_("Too many arguments."), command, name)
    clize.ArgumentError: Too many arguments.
    Usage: ./echo.py [OPTIONS] text

Uff! What happened here?  The shell split "Hello" and "world!" into two
different parameters, and therefore were interpreted to be two
different python arguments.  Before we fix this however, let's make
sure a potential user of the program doesn't see this traceback, but
just the error message.

Change the last part to catch ArgumentError exceptions::

    from clize import clize, ArgumentError

    ...

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        import sys
        import os.path
        try:
            program(*sys.argv)
        except ArgumentError as e:
            print(os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]) + ': ' + str(e),
                  file=sys.stderr)

Much better::

    $ ./echo.py Hello world!
    echo.py: Too many arguments.
    Usage: ./echo.py [OPTIONS] text

Back to our little problem.  We essentially want ``text`` to
recuperate all arguments.  Python functions have a syntax for that,
but you'll have to shift ``text`` to the end of the parameter list::

    @clize
    def echo(reverse=False, *text):
        ...

It is still a list of arguments, just put in one tuple.  You simply
have to join it::

    @clize
    def echo(reverse=False, *text):
        text = ' '.join(text)
        if reverse:
            text = ''.join(reversed(text))
        print(text)

In the shell::

    $ ./echo.py Hello world!
    Hello world!

It will change the documentation to show ``[text...]`` instead of just
``text``.  But... doesn't that mean ``text`` is optional?  Yes, and
most programs want excess arguments to be optional.  But we don't.
It's pointless to run this without text! The decorator has a parameter
for this::

    @clize(require_excess=True)
    def echo(reverse=False, *text):
        text = ' '.join(text)
        if reverse:
            text = ''.join(reversed(text))
        print(text)

And now text is mandatory.

Now, let's document it proper, with a docstring.

::

    @clize(require_excess=True)
    def echo(reverse=False, *text):
        """
        Echoes text back.
        """
        text = ' '.join(text)
        if reverse:
            text = ''.join(reversed(text))
        print(text)

If you look at the help output, you will see that you added a
description for your command.

Document each parameter as it appears in your function like this::

    @clize(require_excess=True)
    def echo(reverse=False, *text):
        """
        Echoes text back.

        text: The text to be echoed

        reverse: Reverse text before echoing
        """
        text = ' '.join(text)
        if reverse:
            text = ''.join(reversed(text))
        print(text)

Should you want to add additional info after the arguments, just do so
in the docstring::

    @clize(require_excess=True)
    def echo(reverse=False, *text):
        """
        Echoes text back.

        text: The text to be echoed

        reverse: Reverse text before echoing

        Beware! There is no warranty this program will not reverse
        your internets!
        """
        text = ' '.join(text)
        if reverse:
            text = ''.join(reversed(text))
        print(text)

This gives us this help string::

    $ ./echo.py --help
    Usage: examples/echo.py [OPTIONS] text...

    Echoes text back

    Positional arguments:
      text...   The text to be echoed

    Options:
      --reverse    Reverse text before echoing
      -h, --help   Show this help

    Beware! There is no warranty this program will not reverse your
    internets!

Finally, you might want to have a shorter name for ``--reverse``.
This can be achieved with the ``alias`` keyword argument of clize,
which is a mapping from source names to a list of additional aliases::

    @clize(require_excess=True,
           alias={
                   'reverse': ('r',),
               },
           )
    def echo(reverse=False, *text):
        ...

You can now use ``-r`` instead of ``--reverse``.  This will be
reflected in the help text too.

Let's add a --version switch, for good measure.

You can add extra flags with the ``extra`` keyword argument. It takes
a sequence of Option objects, but we'll just use the ``make_flag``
helper function here, since it is sufficient.

``make_flag`` takes at least two parameters: ``source`` and ``names``.

* ``source`` is usually the name of the argument from the function
assigned to the option,
* ``names`` is a sequence of names the option will take.  ``help`` is
optional and is the help text assigned to the flag.

When ``source`` is callable, it is called with four keyword parameters,
most of which you can ignore:

* ``name`` corresponds to ``sys.argv[0]`` when called with ``sys.argv``.

* ``command`` is the command object used internally to represent the
  command subject to clize-ation.

* ``val`` is the value passed to the option.

* ``params`` is the mapping of keyword arguments that will be passed
  to the function subject to clize-ation.

If this function returns something true, the command will stop being
processed.

In our case we want the command name and we want the command to stop
once we printed the version::

    def show_version(name, **kwargs):
        print("{0} version 1.0".format(os.path.basename(name)))
        return True

    @clize(
        require_excess=True,
        alias={
                'reverse': ('r',),
            },
        extra=(
                make_flag(
                    source=show_version,
                    names=('version', 'v'),
                    help="Show the version",
                ),
            )
        )
    def echo(reverse=False, *text):
        ...

This gives::

    $ examples/echo.py --version
    echo.py version 1.0

And this concludes this guide of sorts.  You can find the full example
in examples/echo.py

Things that didn't fit in the echo example
==========================================

Keyword arguments to the clize decorator:

help_names
    The different names the help function should take.  Set it to
    an empty tuple to disable the help screen.

force_positional
    A list/tuple of keyword arguments that should be forced into
    being optional positional arguments.

coerce
    A mapping from argument name to type coercion functions.


Sub commands
============

Clize has a basic support for sub commands. Instead of passing one command to run, just pass a tuple of commands::

    @clize
    def echo(reverse=False, *text):
        text = ' '.join(text)
        if reverse:
            text = ''.join(reversed(text))
        print(text)


    @clize
    def shout(*text):
        print(' '.join(text).upper())

    run((echo, shout))

Then you can do::

    script.py shout 'Hello' 
    script.py echo 'Hello'
    script.py echo 'Hello' --reverse

The help message will be adapted weither you use a command or not, and which one.
